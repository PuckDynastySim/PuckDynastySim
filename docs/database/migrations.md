# Database Migrations - Hockey League Simulation System

This comprehensive migration documentation establishes the systematic procedures for database schema evolution within the Hockey League Simulation System. The migration framework ensures consistent database updates while maintaining data integrity and system reliability throughout development and production environments.

## Migration Framework and Versioning Strategy

### Systematic Schema Evolution Approach

The database migration system implements sequential versioning that ensures consistent schema evolution across all environments while maintaining comprehensive audit trails for all structural changes. Migration files utilize timestamp prefixes combined with descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose and scope of each schema modification.

Migration procedures follow established patterns that separate schema changes from data transformations while ensuring atomic operations and rollback capabilities. The framework includes comprehensive validation procedures that verify migration success and data integrity before finalizing schema modifications and releasing locks on database resources.

Version control integration maintains synchronized migration state across development, staging, and production environments with appropriate conflict resolution and deployment coordination procedures. The versioning system includes branching strategies and merge procedures that accommodate parallel development while maintaining consistent database evolution.

Rollback procedures provide reliable schema reversion capabilities for migrations that encounter issues or require modification during deployment processes. Rollback implementation includes data preservation strategies and dependency management that ensures safe migration reversal without data loss or system instability.

### Multi-Tenant Migration Coordination

Multi-tenant migration procedures coordinate schema changes across different organizational boundaries while maintaining appropriate data isolation and tenant-specific customization capabilities. Migration coordination includes validation procedures that ensure changes remain compatible with existing tenant configurations and organizational requirements.

Tenant migration scheduling accommodates different organizational maintenance windows and operational requirements while ensuring consistent schema evolution across all organizational contexts. Scheduling procedures include notification systems and coordination mechanisms that minimize operational disruption during migration execution.

Data migration procedures handle tenant-specific transformations while maintaining isolation boundaries and security requirements throughout the migration process. Data transformation includes validation procedures and integrity verification that ensures accurate data preservation and appropriate organizational boundary maintenance.

Schema customization migration enables tenant-specific modifications while maintaining core system compatibility and upgrade pathways. Customization procedures include compatibility validation and upgrade preparation that ensures long-term system maintainability and operational effectiveness.
