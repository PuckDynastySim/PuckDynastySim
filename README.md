# Hockey League Simulation System

A comprehensive web-based platform for creating and managing virtual hockey leagues with sophisticated simulation mechanics, real-time gameplay, and complete season management capabilities. This system enables commissioners to establish custom leagues while providing general managers with comprehensive team management tools and realistic player development systems.

## System Overview

The Hockey League Simulation System serves as a complete virtual hockey management platform that accommodates multiple organizational structures and league configurations. The application supports three distinct user roles within a hierarchical framework, enabling commissioners to maintain overall league control while empowering general managers to operate their teams with strategic autonomy.

The platform implements a three-tier league structure that mirrors professional hockey organizations. The professional tier represents the highest competitive level with experienced players and comprehensive statistics tracking. The farm system provides developmental opportunities for emerging talent while maintaining direct connections to professional teams through player movement mechanisms. The junior league serves as the foundation tier where players aged 16-21 develop their skills before advancing to higher competitive levels.

### Core Functionality

Player management encompasses comprehensive generation systems that create realistic fictional players with nationality-appropriate names and demographic distributions that reflect actual hockey participation patterns. Each player possesses detailed attribute systems covering both offensive and defensive capabilities, with specialized rating structures for goaltenders that account for position-specific skills such as rebound control and positioning.

The simulation engine processes games using sophisticated algorithms that consider player ratings, coaching strategies, team chemistry, and situational factors to generate authentic hockey experiences. Each simulated game produces detailed statistical outputs including period-by-period scoring summaries, comprehensive play-by-play narratives, individual player performance metrics, and team-level analytics.

Financial systems integrate salary cap management with revenue generation mechanisms, enabling teams to balance competitive spending with long-term financial sustainability. Teams generate income through ticket sales, merchandise, and sponsorship opportunities while managing expenses related to player salaries, facility improvements, and training programs.

## Technology Architecture

### Development Stack

The application utilizes Next.js with React for frontend development, providing server-side rendering capabilities and dynamic user interface components optimized for both desktop and mobile access. The backend architecture employs Node.js with Express for API development and business logic implementation, ensuring scalable performance and maintainable code organization.

Data persistence leverages PostgreSQL as the primary database system with TimescaleDB extensions for efficient management of time-series data including player statistics, game results, and historical performance tracking. This configuration enables complex analytical queries while maintaining optimal performance for real-time operations.

Real-time functionality operates through WebSocket connections implemented via Socket.IO, supporting live game simulation updates, instant messaging between users, and immediate notification delivery. The system architecture accommodates both small recreational leagues and large professional organizations through flexible scaling mechanisms.

### Multi-Tenant Design

The platform implements sophisticated multi-tenant architecture that supports various organizational requirements. Large professional leagues benefit from database-per-tenant isolation ensuring complete data separation and customized performance optimization. Smaller recreational leagues operate efficiently within shared database configurations that utilize row-level security for data protection while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

User authentication employs JSON Web Tokens with role-based access control that implements hierarchical permission structures aligned with hockey league organizational patterns. This approach ensures appropriate access levels while maintaining security across all system components.
